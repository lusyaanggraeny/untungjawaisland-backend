Hey guys! 👋

Just wrapped up the QRIS payment feature - it's live and ready for you to break it! 😄

What's working now:
✅ QRIS payment creation & QR codes
✅ Payment tracking 
✅ Auto booking confirmation
✅ Full Xendit integration

Quick heads up - we're still on Xendit's test keys because they need a bunch of business docs before we can go live:
- Company registration stuff (SIUP/NIB)
- Bank account verification
- KTP for directors
- Business address proof
- Their review process (1-7 days)

So for now it's all test payments (no real money), but everything works exactly like it will in production.

Go ahead and test the whole flow - booking to payment to confirmation. Let me know if anything breaks!

Cheers 🍻
