UNTUNGJAWA HOMESTAY - FRONTEND EMAIL NOTIFICATION INTEGRATION
=======================================================

2. Booking notifications to homestay owners/admins
3. Status update emails when booking status changes

ENDPOINTS
---------
- Authenticated booking: POST /api/booking
- Guest booking: POST /api/booking/guest
- Status updates: PUT /api/booking/:id/status

REQUIRED FIELDS FOR GUEST BOOKINGS
--------------------------------
{
  "guest_name": "required",
  "guest_email": "required",

FRONTEND IMPLEMENTATION TIPS
--------------------------
1. Add "Check your email" success messages after booking completion
2. Consider email verification steps for guest bookings
3. Add email resend option for booking confirmations
4. Show loading state during booking creation (emails add slight processing time)

UI CONSIDERATIONS
----------------
1. Display clear messaging that booking confirmations will be emailed
2. Add instructions to check spam/junk folders
3. Consider a "Didn't receive email?" support option

EMAIL CONTENT OVERVIEW

All emails include:

No additional frontend work is needed for email template rendering or sending logic.
